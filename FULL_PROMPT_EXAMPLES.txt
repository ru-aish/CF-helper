Problem: 2135C - C. By the Assignment

=== FULL PROBLEM STATEMENT ===
For an undirected connected graph of n vertices, where the i-th vertex has a 
weight of v_i, we define the value of a simple path l_1, l_2, ..., l_m as 
v_{l_1} ⊕ v_{l_2} ⊕ ... ⊕ v_{l_m}. We call the graph balanced if and only if:
For every 1 ≤ p < q ≤ n, all simple paths from p to q have the same value.

Aquawave has given you an undirected connected graph of n vertices and m edges, 
and the i-th vertex in the graph has a weight of a_i. However, some of the 
weights are missing, represented by -1.

Aquawave wants to assign an integer weight between 0 and V-1 to each vertex 
with a_i = -1, so that the graph will be balanced.

You have to help Aquawave find the number of ways to assign weights to achieve 
the goal, modulo 998,244,353.

⊕ denotes the bitwise XOR operation.

Input:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of 
test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n, m, and V 
(2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, n-1 ≤ m ≤ min(n(n-1)/2, 4×10^5), 1 ≤ V ≤ 10^9) — the number 
of vertices, the number of edges, and the upper bound of weights.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (-1 ≤ a_i ≤ V-1) — the 
weights of the vertices. a_i = -1 represents that the weight of the i-th vertex 
is missing.

Then m lines follow, the i-th line containing two integers u and v 
(1 ≤ u,v ≤ n) — the two vertices that the i-th edge connects.

It is guaranteed that the given graph is simple and connected.

Output:
For each test case, output a single integer — the number of ways to assign 
weights to make the graph balanced, modulo 998,244,353.

=== NOTES ===
Note:
In the first test case, there are four possible assignments:
a = [0,0,0,0]; a = [0,0,0,1]; a = [0,0,0,2]; a = [0,0,0,3].
It can be shown that all of these assignments can make the graph balanced.

In the second test case, we will pick (p,q) = (1,5). The simple path 
1→2→5 has a value of 2⊕2⊕2 = 2, and the simple path 1→3→5 has a value of 
2⊕a_3⊕2 = a_3, so the only possible value for a_3 is 2. It can be shown that 
a_3 = 2 can make the graph balanced.

In the fifth test case, the given graph is a tree, so there is only one simple 
path between any two vertices. Thus, we can assign an arbitrary value between 
0 and V-1 to each a_i, and the answer is 1,000,000,000^3 mod 998,244,353 = 
747,068,572.

[Message 1] ASSISTANT:
This is a graph XOR path constraint problem with assignment counting. The key is recognizing that for a balanced graph, all cycles must have XOR sum = 0, reducing this to a spanning tree + system of XOR equations over the missing vertices.

[Message 2] USER:
What algorithm should I use to solve this?

Student's message: Can you give me a hint about the approach?
Hints given: 0
