## Example 1: Problem Context Formatting

### BEFORE
```
Problem: 2135C - Card Game
=== FULL PROBLEM STATEMENT ===

```

### AFTER
```
# PROBLEM CONTEXT
**Problem ID**: 2135C
**Title**: Card Game
⏱️ Time: 2 seconds | 💾 Memory: 256 megabytes | ⭐ Rating: 1600 | 🏷️ Tags: greedy, implementation

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
Alice and Bob are playing a card game...

## SAMPLE TEST CASES
⚠️ **Multi-test format**: 5 test cases combined below
**Input:**
```
5
4 4 4
-1 -1 -1 -1
...
```
```

**Impact**: Better visual hierarchy, metadata upfront, clearer structure for AI parsing

## Example 2: Conversation History

### BEFORE
```
=== CONVERSATION HISTORY ===

[Message 1] USER:
How do I solve this?

[Message 2] ASSISTANT:
Think about using greedy approach...
```

### AFTER
```
# CONVERSATION HISTORY
💬 Showing last 15 of 23 messages

## [1] 👤 STUDENT
How do I solve this?

## [2] 🤖 TUTOR
Think about using greedy approach...

## [3] 💡 HINT
Consider sorting the array first...
```

**Impact**: Clear role identification, hint markers, better tracking of conversation flow

---

## Example 3: Hint Progression

### BEFORE
```
Hint #1: Give a direct hint about the main algorithm or technique needed (1-2 sentences).
```

### AFTER
```
# HINT REQUEST
**Hint Level**: 1/4 - Initial Direction
**Instruction**: Identify the main algorithm category (greedy/DP/two-pointer/etc.) and one key observation. 1-2 sentences.

**Important**: 
- Build on previous hints (check conversation history)
- Don't repeat what was already said
- Be progressive - reveal more information than previous hints but not everything
- Stay focused and technical
```

**Impact**: Clear progression strategy, prevents repetition, better hint quality

## Example 4: Code Analysis Request

### BEFORE
```
Please analyze their code comprehensively and provide:
1. **Correctness Analysis**: Is the approach correct?
2. **Algorithm Identification**: What algorithm/technique did they use?
...
```

### AFTER
```
# CODE ANALYSIS REQUEST
The student has submitted code for review. Analyze it systematically:

## 1. CORRECTNESS ✓/✗
- **Verdict**: Does the approach solve the problem correctly?
- **Algorithm Used**: Identify the technique/algorithm
- **Logic Check**: Are the core steps implemented correctly?

## 2. BUGS & ISSUES 🐛
- **Compilation/Syntax**: Any syntax errors?
- **Logic Errors**: Incorrect conditions, loop bounds, edge cases?
- **Runtime Issues**: Array out of bounds, division by zero, overflow?
- List specific line numbers if applicable
...
```

**Impact**: Systematic analysis, visual indicators, actionable feedback format

## Example 5: Solution Request

### BEFORE
```
Provide a complete solution with:
1. Clear approach explanation
2. Clean code implementation
3. Time and space complexity analysis
4. Key insights
```

### AFTER
```
# SOLUTION REQUEST
The student has requested a complete solution. Provide:

## 1. APPROACH OVERVIEW (3-5 sentences)
- Main algorithm/technique used
- Key insight that makes it work
- Why this approach is optimal for the constraints

## 2. ALGORITHM STEPS (numbered list)
Break down the solution into clear steps

## 3. CODE IMPLEMENTATION
[specific formatting requirements]

## 4. COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS
- **Time Complexity**: O(?) with brief justification
- **Space Complexity**: O(?) with brief justification

## 5. KEY INSIGHTS (2-3 bullet points)
- Critical observations that lead to the solution
- Why naive approaches fail
- Edge cases or optimizations
```

**Impact**: Structured output, clear expectations, complete information

## Technical Improvements in `ai_service.py`

### Problem Context Builder
```python
# BEFORE: Plain text
context_parts.append(f"\n=== TAGS ===\n{', '.join(tags)}")

# AFTER: Structured with emojis
metadata.append(f"🏷️ Tags: {', '.join(tags[:5])}")
context_parts.append(" | ".join(metadata))
```

### Code Extraction
```python
# BEFORE: Manual line-by-line parsing
for line in lines:
    if '```' in line:
        if in_code_block:
            code_blocks.append('\n'.join(current_code))

# AFTER: Regex-based extraction
code_pattern = r'```(?:\w+)?\n(.*?)\n```'
matches = re.findall(code_pattern, response_text, re.DOTALL)
code_blocks = matches if matches else []
```

### Complexity Extraction
```python
# BEFORE: Simple string check
if 'complexity' in line.lower() and 'O(' in line:
    complexity_info = line.strip()

# AFTER: Pattern matching
complexity_pattern = r'(?:Time|Space)\s*Complexity[:\s]+O\([^)]+\)'
complexity_matches = re.findall(complexity_pattern, response_text, re.IGNORECASE)
complexity_info = ' | '.join(complexity_matches)
```

## Response Quality Comparison

### Hint Response Quality

**BEFORE** (with old prompts):
> "You should think about using a greedy approach here. Have you considered sorting? Let me know if you need more hints!"

**AFTER** (with new prompts):
> "Use greedy selection with sorting. Key insight: selecting the smallest available card minimizes future conflicts. Sort both arrays and match greedily from left to right - O(n log n)."

### Code Analysis Quality

**BEFORE**:
> "Your code looks mostly correct but there might be some edge cases. The complexity seems okay."

**AFTER**:
> "✓ Algorithm correct: Greedy with sorting. 🐛 Bug on line 23: `i <= n` causes array overflow (should be `i < n`). 🧪 Will fail on test case with n=1. Fix: Change loop condition. Current O(n log n) is optimal."

## Testing Results

✅ **Syntax Check**: All Python files compile without errors  
✅ **File Structure**: All prompt files updated and saved  
✅ **Git Ignore**: Comprehensive `.gitignore` created  
✅ **Documentation**: `PROMPT_IMPROVEMENTS.md` created  

## Next Steps

1. Start the server and test with a real problem
2. Request hints 1-4 to verify progression
3. Submit code for analysis to check formatting
4. Request solution to verify structured output
5. Monitor API logs for prompt quality
